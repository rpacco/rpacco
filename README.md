# **About Me**

I'm a data professional with a diversified background. I began my career as a mechanical engineer in the Brazilian Navy, contributing to the country's nuclear-powered submarine project. In this role, I crafted and reviewed technical documents, adhered to safety requirements, and participated in activity planning.

Currently, I work as a freelancer, catering to clients primarily in Data Mining/Scrapping, extracting data from various sources and formats. I preprocess this data to ensure integrity and quality for client delivery.

I also hold a master's degree in Financial Engineering from World Quant University, where I developed my understanding of the global financial market, analyzed financial data, designed programs using Python, applied stochastic calculations for pricing and derivatives hedging, and evaluated portfolios and their risk profiles using portfolio management theory. I also have experience in identifying risks related to the financial market and developing risk mitigation strategies, as well as evaluating current trends in the global financial scenario.
